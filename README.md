# DDX3_manuscript_analysis
a collection of data, scripts and plots for our manuscript about DDX3 functions in HEK293 cells (*to be added soon*):

In this repository we included the post-processing analysis scripts for Ribo-seq, RNA-seq and PAR-CLIP experiments performed in HEK293 cells.
Part 1 deals with the initial analysis of gene expression changes, while Part 2 is focused on the analysis of protein binding as defined by PAR-CLIP.
